### Hello World !
In elementary school, I was already interested in computers and everything related to them. My interest in programming began when I watched my friends making games while I modeled objects and characters in Blender, which we then added to the game. Now, I want to spend more time learning programming because solving problems gives me a lot of satisfaction and joy. I would like to improve my skills at work by creating better and more efficient code.

I think programming is not just a job, but also a passion that helps me get better and learn new things. I hope to become an expert in this field and share my knowledge with others. In the future, I would like to work on bigger projects that make a real difference in people's lives, which motivates me to keep learning and growing.
